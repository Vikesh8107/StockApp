# React Native Stock Tracker

Welcome to the React Native Stock Tracker project! This mobile application allows you to track stock prices using the Polygon API. The application is built with React Native and has a Node.js backend.

## Getting Started

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start


Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:
For Android

# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android

For iOS

# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios

Modifying Your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it:

    Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
    For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> for Windows/Linux, <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> for macOS) to see your changes!
    For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

    User Input: Take an integer "n" from the user as input.
    Polygon API Integration: Fetch n stocks from the Polygon API and add a unique key called "refreshInterval" for each, ranging between 1-5 seconds.
    Previous Close Prices: Fetch previous close prices for the stocks and store them in a file.
    Real-time Updates: Update stock prices at specified refresh intervals with random values.
